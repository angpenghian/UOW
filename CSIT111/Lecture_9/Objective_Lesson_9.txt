Objective Lesson 9

- Revisit last example
  : the use of if, if-else, nested if-else
- switch statements
  : falling thru features
 
 ==> scope of lab 4 and term test in order
 ==> will be out later
 
- Repetition designs
  : while loop
  : for loop
  : do while loop
  : nested loops
  : continue, break ==> avoid using them
